# Adventure-Game-Final-Project
This is a text based choose-your-own adventure game that places the player in an unfamiliar environment in which they must check and search their surroundings, find new items, and engage enemies in order to escape their confinement.

This game will be purely text based and will have consequences for taking or not taking certain items throughout the game, creating branching paths along the way.
